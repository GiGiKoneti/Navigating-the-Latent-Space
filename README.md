📍 **Venue:** Building 13, Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering (DSCE), Bangalore  
📅 **Date:** 10th December 2025  
⏱ **Duration:** 6 Hours  
🎓 **Type:** Research & Conceptual Seminar  

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents the complete intellectual framework, theoretical foundations, and applied methodologies presented in the **6-hour seminar** titled:

**“Navigating the Latent Space through Advanced Prompt Engineering”**

The seminar explores **Prompt Engineering not as a heuristic skill**, but as a **formal, mathematical, and cognitive interface** between human intent and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The content is designed at a **research depth**, bridging:
- Probability theory  
- Latent space geometry  
- Information theory  
- Bayesian reasoning  
- Optimization and control  
- Human–AI interaction  

---

## 🎯 Seminar Objective

The primary goal of this seminar was to help students and researchers:

- Understand **how LLMs actually work internally**
- Model prompting as **probabilistic control over latent spaces**
- Reduce hallucinations using **reasoning and self-consistency**
- Use AI as a **thinking partner**, not a black-box tool
- Transition from *chat-style prompting* to *engineering-grade prompting*

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> **Prompt Engineering is not asking better questions —  
it is programming probability distributions using natural language.**

This seminar reframes prompting as:
- **Declarative programming**
- **Constraint satisfaction**
- **Entropy shaping**
- **Latent space navigation**

## 🧩 Seminar Structure (6 Hours)

### **Phase 1 — Theory (Foundations)**
- Evolution of Human–AI interaction
- Feature Engineering vs Prompt Engineering
- Next-token prediction & probabilistic modeling
- Attention mechanism (Transformer intuition)
- Context window & information compression
- Geometry of latent space

---

### **Phase 2 — Techniques (Applied Science)**
- Instruction Tuning (Context + Task + Data + Output)
- In-Context Learning (Zero / One / Few-shot)
- Chain-of-Thought prompting
- Self-Consistency & variance reduction
- Alignment and hallucination control

---

### **Phase 3 — Case Studies (Cognitive Control)**
- Creative prompting (Divergent thinking)
- Constraint manipulation & bisociation
- Effective writing via recursive prompting
- Style transfer, tone control, and refinement
- AI as an editor, not a ghostwriter

---

## 🔬 Research-Level Perspective

The seminar treats LLMs as:

- **Probabilistic sequence models**
- **High-dimensional semantic manifolds**
- **Stochastic reasoning systems**

Key techniques are explained using:
- Entropy minimization & maximization
